#Smoking Hot Data

<hr/>

### Repo Collaborators

This repository houses the work of Anthony Alvarez, Daniel Evans, Sonia Kingslien, and Ly-Bach Truong.

### Technologies Used
The group utilizes several Python/Javascript libraries, such as PyMongo, pandas, Flask, D3, and Taucharts to import data from several CSV files into a NoSQL database (MongoDB) and serves the data to the end user through the utilization of RESTful APIs in the form of data visualizations.

### Notes regarding matters of the code and its dependencies

Taucharts has an issue with its framework where the visualizations only display properly once the window is resized. Afterwards though, there is no further issue and it remains interactive and gets the point across.
